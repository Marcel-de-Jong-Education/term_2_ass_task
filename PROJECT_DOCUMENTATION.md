### By Marcel de Jong

# Sprint 1
## Requirements Definition
### Functional Requirements

#### Graphics

* Circles in a window at positions representing the objects.
* Coloured Circles 

#### Physics

* Gravity

#### Simulated Space

* Toroidal space 

#### Optimisation

* N/A

#### User Interface <Sprint 1 priority>

* Right-click to open a menu on the cursor’s position
* Delete menu on left-click and reopen in new position on right-click
* Typable inputs
* Implement menu potence

### Non-Functional Requirements

* Statically Compiled

## Determining Specifications
### Functional Specifications

#### User Requirements

* The user needs to be able to spawn objects in the programme.
* The user will be able to specify information about the object prior to spawning it via a menu opened by clicking at a position on the window.
* The menu will include x and y velocities of the object, it's size, mass and type.
* A button labelled "Go" in the bottom right will spawn an object with the aforementioned specifications at the location the menu was opened.
